# Baba Is You solver

This repo contains the code for a program that can solve levels from the video game *Baba Is You*.

## Limitations

The program has the following limitations. Eventually I'd like to change the code so that it no
longer has these limitations.

1. Currently, the program can only solve one level, The Floatiest Platforms (Mountain-Extra 1).
2. Currently, the program can only run on Windows.
