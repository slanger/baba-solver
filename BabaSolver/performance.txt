TotalMoves(n) = 4^1 + 4^2 + ... + 4^n, where n is the max move depth
(Note: This formula ignores cached moves and other tree-pruning techniques.)

TotalMoves(3) = 4 + 16 + 64 = 84 moves
TotalMoves(5) = 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 = 1364 moves
TotalMoves(20) = 1,466,015,503,700 moves
TotalMoves(25) = 1,501,199,875,790,164 moves
TotalMoves(30) = 1,537,228,672,809,129,300 moves

Simple Go program for TotalMoves():

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

const N = 30

func totalMoves(maxDepth int) uint64 {
	var total uint64 = 0
	for i := 1; i <= maxDepth; i++ {
		total += uint64(math.Pow(4, float64(i)))
	}
	return total
}

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%d\n", totalMoves(N))
}
